# CONTRIBUTING

We're using Github Actions as a continuous integration system.

## Tests

We're using [`grumphp/grumphp`](https://github.com/phpro/grumphp) to drive the
development.

Run

```bash
./vendor/bin/grumphp run
```

to run all the tests.

## Coding Standards

We are using [`ecphp/php-conventions`](https://github.com/ecphp/php-conventions)
to enforce coding standards.

Run

```bash
./vendor/bin/grumphp run
```

to automatically detect/fix coding standard violations.
